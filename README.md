# QuizGame3D
 
This is a 3D quiz-style game built in Unity.

At the center of the scene stands a main board that displays an image.
On both left and right sides there are answer boards with possible answers.

When a new image appears, player must step onto the platform with the correct answer before the timer runs out.
If the player chooses correctly, the game continues with a new image and question.
If the player makes a mistake, the game ends.

The project demonstrates:

* Interactive 3D gameplay in Unity

* Timed events and user input

* Simple quiz mechanics combined with spatial movement

* Simple AI for better look
